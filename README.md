# Tic-Tac-Toe
The rules are described below :

X always goes first.
Players cannot play on a played position.
Players alternate placing X’s and O’s on the board until either:
One player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally
All nine squares are filled.
If a player is able to draw three X’s or three O’s in a row, that player wins.
If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
